                  I went to SDSU for âš¡ Electrical Engineering âš¡ but I consider
                  myself to be mostly self taught. HTML/CSS/JS, Git, Github,
                  Ruby on Rails and Node JS were not taught in my curriculum.
                  The vast majority of what I learned was online.

                  in San Diego. Bootcamps are great if you need a more
                  hands-on/classroom setting, but they can be a pretty big time
                  and money commitment.

                  I don't pretend to know everything and I don't just skip to
                  solutions. One of the hardest things to learn in coding is how
                  to solve your own problems. You'll see exactly what I Google
                  and how I debug issues that come up.

                  I give you the practical stuff you need to know and the
                  resources to learn more. This is the path I wish someone
                  taught me when I was learning to code.
